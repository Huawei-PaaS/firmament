Ephemeral Storage and Events support.
Static Persistant Volume support is also avaliable from the V0.5 'Poseidon' release.

# Static Persistant Volume support

This works with V0.5 Poseidon release. 
There is no change for this feature in firmament.

Pre-Bound PVC to a PV will be picked by 'Poseidon' if a Pod has that PVC requirement.

It will be used as a node selector term in the NodeAffinity 'Hard-constraint' section of the Pod.

When 'Frimament' try to schedule this Task it will try to satify the NodeAffinity Hard Constraints, 
which will result in the Pod getting scheduled on the Node which satisfy the PV's NodeSelector term.
